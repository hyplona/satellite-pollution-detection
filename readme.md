# Satellite-Based Pollution Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project uses satellite imagery to detect and classify pollution in air, water, and land using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Data
The data is sourced from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-5P satellites via Google Earth Engine. It covers various pollution types such as smog, oil spills, algal blooms, and illegal dumping.
